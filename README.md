# Mailcow Darkmode
### With the upcoming update 08/2022 Mailcow changes to Bootstrap 5, which means that also a darkmode with switch button is included. 

### I will have a look at the implementation of the darkmode, should it not meet my expectations, I will of course continue to work on this repo.

### Thanks for your support. Stay healthy!
