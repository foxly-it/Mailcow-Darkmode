 Complete CSS customization for the administration interface

I have customized the administration interface via CSS. Unfortunately there is no official darkmode in Mailcow yet.Â

## Usage

Copy either the complete file or just the CSS code to ```/opt/mailcow-dockerized/data/web/css/build/0081-custom-mailcow.css```
